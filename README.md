# COVID-Xray-Detection

Uses Convolutional Neural Networks & Transfer Learning to identify chest x-rays that are infected with Covid-19. 
Various datasets containing x-rays images that are normal, infected with Covid, tuberculosis and pneumonia are used for training and testing. 
The concept of transfer learning is used here and the CNN is built on top of the VGG16 model.
